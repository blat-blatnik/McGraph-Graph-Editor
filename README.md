# McGraph Graph Editor

Mc Graph is a GUI program for editing and solving common graph-theory problems. It can find shortest distance paths, and perform graph coloring. All graphs without cyclic edges are supported - including directed graphs, weighed graphs, and graphs with negative weight cycles.

This program was made for a 2-week assignment in Object Oriented Programming, so it was a collaborative project with [my lab partner](https://github.com/janaheit). The requirements for the assignment were quite simple and basic to implement, so we added a lot of extensions such as animations, the graph solver functionality, UI customization, etc. which actually turned this into a usable program.

## Requirements

[Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) version 1.8 or higher.

## How to run

[Download]() `mcgraph.jar`, then run `$ java -jar mcgraph.jar`.

## Licence

This program and all of its source code are in the public domain, you can use them for anything you want. Enjoy :)
