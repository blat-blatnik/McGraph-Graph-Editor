# McGraph Graph Editor

McGraph is a GUI program for editing and solving common graph-theory problems. It can find shortest distance paths, and perform graph coloring. All graphs without self-looping edges are supported.

This program was made for a 1-month assignment in Object Oriented Programming, so it was a collaborative project with [my lab partner](https://github.com/janaheit). The requirements for the assignment were quite simple and basic to implement, so we added a lot of extensions such as animations, the graph solver functionality, UI customization, etc. which actually turned this into a usable program.
